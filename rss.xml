            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>'Bike to the Future': Design Museum Gent considers a world of two-wheeled design.</h1><p>'Bike to the Future' is the latest testament to a cycling revolution we've been witnessing since the 1960s. But the Design Museum Gent isn't interested in the past; between 25 March - 23 October it showcases a collection of contemporary models from the new millennium, including Philippe Starck's electric bike 'MASS' or Tobias Knockaert's laser-cut bicycle, and prototypes and experiments for the future, with unusual aesthetics, materials and functions.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/e75dd9b06e93c20d73aed8ffe8845b13b5208794.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Light Phone: Designed for Disconnecting</h1><p>Phone addiction is real-as evidenced by a quick glance down the street, in the subway, even at the dinner table-and is one of the reasons why Apple developed a watch: so we would look at our screens less and be present more. For some, however, a smartwatch isn't enough-it still leaves room for fiddling and distraction.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/83d0f5ce299ad3d7f079d449896c88dcc2ec48b8.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Beautiful Speedometer for Bikes</h1><p>Shout-out to designers who are also obsessed with cycling because their work frequently results in something new and clever, like the arresting Omata One. Mounted onto a bike, the speedometer's unique analog face informs of the four most relevant ride metrics (speed, distance, ascent and time).</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d105236023603a813c26d257fbe058ad72b3f663.jpg"></article>]]></description>
